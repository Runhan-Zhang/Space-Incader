# FPGA Space Invaders

hello~

this is a projects improved by four sophomore students from Wuhan University.
the main function it can realize is to play a simple space-invader game with the use of FPGA.

Frankly speaking, about this project, git has already had these simple codes. Of course, we use this project from git for reference.
However, there is something different from source code. 
We added module HC-05 bluetooth to realize the communication batween phone and FPGA. We added switches to select the game level. We added OpenMV to detect faces which is the criterion of whether to enter into game.
